# Ball Animation Solutions

This project contains two different solutions to animate balls moving from left to right across the screen in a Processing sketch. Each solution is implemented in a separate file: one using a procedural approach and the other using an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach.

## Files

- `ProceduralMethodSolution.java`: Implements the ball animation using a procedural approach.
- `OOPSolution.java`: Implements the ball animation using an object-oriented approach.

## Task Description

The task requires animating four balls moving from left to right with different speeds and heights. Specifically:

- Ball 1 is at 1/5 height from the top, with a speed of 1 unit per frame.
- Ball 2 is at 2/5 height from the top, with a speed of 2 units per frame.
- Ball 3 is at 3/5 height from the top, with a speed of 3 units per frame.
- Ball 4 is at 4/5 height from the top, with a speed of 4 units per frame.
